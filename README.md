**Government Complaint Management System**

**1. Introduction**
The Government Complaint Management System is a C++ console-based application designed to allow citizens to register complaints and enable government officials to manage them efficiently. This system ensures transparency and efficiency in handling public grievances.

**2. Objectives**
- Enable citizens to submit complaints regarding government services.
- Provide a secure user authentication mechanism.
- Allow officials to manage and update complaint statuses.
- Store and retrieve complaints using file handling.
- Improve user experience with better error handling and input validation.

**3. Features**
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Users can sign up as either citizens or government officials. Passwords are hashed for security.
- **Complaint Registration**: Citizens can submit complaints along with their government ID and name.
- **View Complaints**: Citizens can view their submitted complaints and track their status.
- **Complaint Management**: Government officials can view all complaints and update their status.
- **File Handling**: Data is stored in text files (`users.txt` and `complaints.txt`) for persistence.
- **Error Handling**: The system checks for missing files, invalid inputs, and ensures smooth execution.

**4. Implementation Details**
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Data Storage**: File handling (Text Files)
- **Security**: Simple password hashing function implemented.
- **User Interface**: Console-based menu-driven interaction.

**5. Code Structure**
- **Main Functions**:
  - `registerUser()`: Registers a new user with hashed password storage.
  - `loginUser()`: Authenticates users based on stored credentials.
  - `registerComplaint()`: Allows citizens to submit complaints.
  - `viewMyComplaints()`: Displays complaints associated with a userâ€™s government ID.
  - `manageComplaints()`: Enables officials to update complaint statuses.

**6. System Flowchart**
Below is a basic flowchart outlining the complaint management process:
```
         Start
           |
     User Registration/Login
           |
 Citizen  ----  Official
   |              |
 Register     View Complaints
 Complaint     & Update Status
   |              |
 View My      Change Status
 Complaints   to 'Resolved'
   |              |
    --------------
          |
         End
```

**7. Enhancements & Future Scope**
- Implement a database (MySQL or SQLite) for better data management.
- Introduce a GUI for better usability.
- Enhance security using advanced encryption techniques.
- Develop a web or mobile application for broader accessibility.

**8. Testing & Validation**
- **Test Case 1**: User registration with an existing username should fail.
- **Test Case 2**: Logging in with incorrect credentials should display an error.
- **Test Case 3**: Submitting a complaint without a valid government ID should be restricted.
- **Test Case 4**: Officials should be able to update complaint status correctly.

**9. Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrates a simple yet effective complaint management system for government services. It provides a structured approach to grievance handling and ensures better communication between citizens and officials.
