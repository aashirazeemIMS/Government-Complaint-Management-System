- 👀 **View Complaints**: Citizens can view their **submitted complaints** and track their status.
- 🏛 **Complaint Management**: Government officials can view **all complaints** and update their status.
- 📁 **File Handling**: Data is stored in **text files** (`users.txt` and `complaints.txt`) for persistence.
- ⚠ **Error Handling**: The system checks for **missing files**, **invalid inputs**, and ensures smooth execution.

**4. Implementation Details**
- 💻 **Programming Language**: **C++**
- 🗄 **Data Storage**: **File handling (Text Files)**
- 🔐 **Security**: **Simple password hashing** function implemented.
- 🖥 **User Interface**: **Console-based menu-driven interaction**.

**5. Code Structure**
- 🔹 **Main Functions**:
  - `registerUser()`: Registers a new user with **hashed password storage**.
  - `loginUser()`: **Authenticates** users based on stored credentials.
  - `registerComplaint()`: Allows citizens to **submit complaints**.
  - `viewMyComplaints()`: Displays complaints associated with a user’s **government ID**.

**6. System Flowchart**
Below is a basic **flowchart** outlining the complaint management process:
```
         Start
           |
     User Registration/Login
           |
 Citizen  ----  Official
   |              |
 Register     View Complaints
 Complaint     & Update Status
   |              |
 View My      Change Status
 Complaints   to 'Resolved'
   |              |
    --------------
          |
         End
```

**7. Enhancements & Future Scope**
- 🔹 **Implement a database** (MySQL or SQLite) for better data management.
- 🎨 **Introduce a GUI** for better usability.
- 🔐 **Enhance security** using advanced encryption techniques.
- 📱 **Develop a web or mobile application** for broader accessibility.

**8. Testing & Validation**
- ✅ **Test Case 1**: **User registration** with an existing username should fail.
- ❌ **Test Case 2**: Logging in with **incorrect credentials** should display an error.
- 🚫 **Test Case 3**: Submitting a complaint without a **valid government ID** should be restricted.
- ⚙ **Test Case 4**: **Officials should be able to update complaint status** correctly.

**9. Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrates a **simple yet effective complaint management system** for government services. It provides a structured approach to **grievance handling** and ensures **better communication** between citizens and officials.
